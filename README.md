# Agentic Router Provider for Copilot

**The client-side adapter that connects GitHub Copilot Chat to [AgenticRouter](https://github.com/davidpizon/agent-as-a-router)** 🔥

## Why this exists

VS Code's Copilot Chat model picker only knows how to talk to a fixed set of built-in providers. This extension registers itself as an additional `LanguageModelChatProvider` that exposes **exactly one model** to Copilot Chat — the Agentic Router — and forwards every request through it.

That single model points at whatever endpoint you set in `totallyhot.spark.baseUrl`. By running a **Custom Agentic Router** such as [**AgenticRouter**](https://github.com/davidpizon/agent-as-a-router), a local reverse proxy that fronts multiple backend models behind one OpenAI-compatible endpoint and picks which model handles each request under a performance/cost tradeoff, this extension is what makes it easy to configure VS Code to use it. AgenticRouter (like most system/local proxies) expects clients to be pointed at it explicitly via `base_url`; Copilot Chat has no built-in way to do that, so this extension is the piece that fills the gap. In that setup:

- VS Code / Copilot Chat stays the editor-side UI, talking to one model in the picker.
- This extension is the connective layer — set `totallyhot.spark.baseUrl` to your AgenticRouter proxy address (e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:5001/v1`) and it forwards chat requests, tool calls, and streaming responses to it.
- AgenticRouter decides what happens next: which backend model actually handles the request and what comes back. **The fan-out across many models lives server-side in the router, not in this extension.**

The extension itself doesn't implement routing logic — that's AgenticRouter's job. What it provides is the standards-compliant bridge and the settings/UI to configure the one endpoint. You can also point it directly at a single OpenAI, Ollama, Anthropic, or Gemini endpoint when you don't need a router at all — just pick the protocol with `totallyhot.spark.apiMode`.

## ✨ Features
- **One model, any protocol**: a single configured model that can speak OpenAI, OpenAI-Responses, Ollama, Anthropic, or Gemini via `totallyhot.spark.apiMode`
- **Auto-retry**: Handles API errors (429, 500, 502, 503, 504) with exponential backoff
- **Token usage**: Real-time token counting from the status bar
- **Git integration**: Generate commit messages directly from source control
- **Tools optimization**: Optimize agent `read_file` tool handling, avoid reading small chunks for large files.

## Requirements
- VS Code 1.104.0 or higher.

## ⚡ Quick Start

Setup means giving the extension a connection string (`baseUrl`) to [AgenticRouter](https://github.com/davidpizon/agent-as-a-router)'s local proxy.

1. Install the TotallyHot Spark extension [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=davidpizon.totallyhot-spark).
2. Open VS Code Settings and set `totallyhot.spark.baseUrl`, `totallyhot.spark.modelId`, and (if needed) `totallyhot.spark.apiMode`.
3. Open GitHub Copilot Chat and pick the model from the model picker — the single configured model is selected by default.

## Migration Notes

This release includes a hard key-namespace rename to `totallyhot.spark` with no compatibility shim.

Required actions:

1. Rename every extension settings key to the `totallyhot.spark.*` prefix in your `settings.json`.
2. If you use log files, check the new path `~/.copilot/totallyhot.spark/logs/`.

### Settings Example

```json
{
  "totallyhot.spark.baseUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:5001/v1",
  "totallyhot.spark.modelId": "auto",
  "totallyhot.spark.modelName": "Agentic Router",
  "totallyhot.spark.apiMode": "openai"
}
```

## ✨ Configuration UI

The extension provides a visual configuration panel for the single model without editing JSON by hand.

### Opening the Configuration UI

There are two ways to open the configuration interface:

1. **From the Command Palette**:
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS)
   - Search for "TotallyHot Spark: Open Configuration UI"
   - Select the command to open the configuration panel

2. **From the Status Bar**:
   - Click on the "TotallyHot Spark" status bar item in the bottom-right corner of VS Code

The panel edits the same flat settings described below (base URL, model id, display name, API mode) plus retry, delay, and commit-language options. Save writes them to your global settings.

## ✨ API Mode

The single model can speak five different API protocols. Choose which one to use with the top-level `totallyhot.spark.apiMode` setting.

| `apiMode` | Endpoint | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `openai` (default) | `/chat/completions` | Most OpenAI-compatible endpoints (AgenticRouter, ModelScope, SiliconFlow, ...) |
| `openai-responses` | `/responses` | OpenAI Responses API and compatible gateways |
| `ollama` | `/api/chat` | Local Ollama instances |
| `anthropic` | `/v1/messages` | Anthropic Claude endpoints |
| `gemini` | `/v1beta/models/{model}:streamGenerateContent?alt=sse` | Google Gemini endpoints |

Each API mode uses different message-conversion logic internally to match the provider-specific request/response format (tools, images, thinking). No API key or auth header is sent by the extension — authenticate at the endpoint itself (e.g. the Agentic Router proxy) if needed.

## Settings Reference

The extension is configured entirely through flat `totallyhot.spark.*` settings — there is a single model.

| Setting | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `totallyhot.spark.baseUrl` | string | Base URL of the Agentic Router (or any OpenAI-compatible) endpoint. All requests are sent here. |
| `totallyhot.spark.modelId` | string | The model id sent (as the `model` field) upstream and shown in the Copilot model picker. Defaults to `auto` so the Agentic Router auto-selects the best model. Set to a configured route name (e.g. `gpt-5.4`) for normal multi-model routing; empty exposes no model. Edit via `settings.json` — not shown in the configuration UI. |
| `totallyhot.spark.modelName` | string | (Optional) Display name shown in the picker. Defaults to the model id. |
| `totallyhot.spark.apiMode` | enum | Protocol used to talk to the endpoint (see [API Mode](#-api-mode)). Default `openai`. |
| `totallyhot.spark.allowInsecureTls` | boolean | Skip TLS certificate verification — only for `localhost`/`127.0.0.1`/`::1` endpoints (e.g. a local dev proxy with a self-signed cert). Never applied to remote hosts. Default `false`. |
| `totallyhot.spark.warnOnHttp1` | boolean | Warn (once per host, via a notification + log) when a request connects over HTTP/1.1 instead of negotiating HTTP/2. Requests work either way — HTTP/2 is opportunistic. Default `true`. |
| `totallyhot.spark.retry` | object | Retry behavior for API errors (`enabled`, `max_attempts`, `interval_ms`, `status_codes`). |
| `totallyhot.spark.delay` | number | Minimum delay in ms between consecutive requests. Default `0`. |
| `totallyhot.spark.commitLanguage` | string | Language for generated Git commit messages. Default `English`. |
| `totallyhot.spark.commitMessagePrompt` | string | Custom system prompt for commit message generation. |
| `totallyhot.spark.readFileLines` | number | Lines to read with the `read_file` tool (`0` = let the model decide). |
| `totallyhot.spark.logLevel` | enum | Debug log level written to `~/.copilot/totallyhot.spark/logs/`. Default `off`. |
